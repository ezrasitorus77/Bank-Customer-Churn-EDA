I created 5 sessions to make people understand easier.
The first session is Business Problem. This is a brief elaboration to preview what causes the problem for Bank Purwad (fictitious). Next session, ("Tujuan EDA") comply my main objective and stakeholders clearly. Third session ("Mengecek - menangani missing values serta melihat korelasi secara umum") is the part where I check and handle missing values and also correlation generally. More indepth analysis and correlations provided in the next session ("Analisis Variabel"). Here I explain the statistical methodology, manipulate data, and also analyze the three variables ("Age", "Balance", and "IsActiveMember") I consider important. The last session ("Rekomenadsi") contains three recomendations that I found useful and beneficial for the stakeholders.
